        <h3>Week 6 22.03</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>During this week we were introduced to systems thinking by Rea Lavi and we learnt about the SAFO framework!</p>
        <p>We learnt these concepts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>System Architecture: Refer to what the system is and how it operates.</li>
          <li>System Function: Refer to what the system does.</li>
          <li>System Outcome: Refers to the problem being solved by the system and its benefits as well as its tradeoffs.</li>
        </ul>

        <!--
          Today we were introduced to systems thinkin by Rea Lavi

          Learnt about SAFO Framework

          System Architecture- What is the system and how it operates

          System Function -  What does the system do?

          System Outcome - In what ways does the system affect people
            - Problem solved by system
            - Groups of people affected by system function
            - Benefit: Intended positive outcome
            - Tradeoff: Expected negative outcome (detriment)

            Unexpected negative outcome is an emergency

            Duda Energy (Company that sells KNO3, NaNO3)

            Why there was a hole in the cointainer?
            
            Issues with the container. 

            Stainless steel for the box, one was heated and became golden, and the other one hasn't been heated up yet.

            MIT Central Machine shop -> where the boxes were made

            We have to research how good of a conductor is each salt

            Use thermal transfer fluids as tubes around the box and around the cooking surface, whcih lets us how fast or slow the fluid moves, letting
            us control the temperature

            Could use different amount of tubes in four sections

            Put some walls around box with baffles so that fluid moves back ad forth through box surface to get hot and spend as much atime as possible
            in the surface

            See https://www.mcmaster.com/ for ideas

            6x7x11 inch size of box -> 85% filled with salt

            On a conceptual level, what things should we test

      <div class="">
        <p>During that week we also investigated two metal boxes containing salts</p>
        <p><img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/saltbox.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>The boxes were made in the MIT Central Machine shop and theirsize was 6x7x11 inches with approximately 85% of the box filled with salt.</p>
        <p>We also suggested to possibly use thermal transfer fluids around the box and cooking surface to transfer heat across the system.</p>
